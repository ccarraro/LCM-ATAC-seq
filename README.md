# LCM-ATAC-seq
Scripts to reproduce the LCM-ATAC-seq analysis by Carraro C. et al, Cell Reports Methods, 2023

Related R environments with associated Session Info are freely accessible on Zenodo (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.8269143). Separate annotated scripts and environments are available for the analysis of mouse lung and brain, mouse spleen and human lung datasets.
To ensure the reproducibility of the manuscript results, all the analyses were conducted within a containerized environment (Docker). Analyses were performed with the docker image jsschrepping/r_docker:jss_R410_scEpi (https://hub.docker.com/r/jsschrepping/r_docker).
